# 2B-Decision Tree implementation

This section will develop a decision tree computationally from first principles

- Function to split data
- Function to determine when a terminal node is reached
- Function to compute the split criterion
	- Gini
	- Variance
	- Chi-square
	- cforest
- Function for prediction
 
 Run the iris data down this tree to pre
